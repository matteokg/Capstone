# Capstone
# RFRMR - COLLAB - Music Page
## Overview
RFRMR is a site that connects people who want to collaborate. The user creates ":Sprouts" which are ideas, or projects they have, and set what they are looking for; be it designers, engineers or whatever is needed. The page I will be working on connects musicians who want to collaborate with other artists. I will be using vue-JS for the front end framework.

## Functionality
The user will be able to select a number of different options for their Sprout after selecting the new sprout page: What kind of song they want to make, what DAW they are working with, what kind of collaboration they are looking for, how many contributors they want, and whether it is a private or public Sprout. After selecting these options, they will be taken to a "New Sprout" page, where they will be able to upload project files, samples, and various packs. These files will be stored on the back-end and be available for download by the Sprout contributors. 

## Data Model
User - The user of the page

Project File - A working file that can be changed with upload. This will correspond to the DAW the Sprout is working with.
